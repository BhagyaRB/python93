an interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely.  

2)Difference between compiled and  interpreted languages
  A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters.
An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.








2
There are at least two steps to get from source code to execution.
There is only one steps to get from source code to execution.
3
In this language, compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.
While in this language, interpreted programs can be modified while the program is running.
4


In this language, compilation errors prevent the code from compiling.
In this languages, all the debugging occurs at run-time.
5
The code of compiled language can be executed directly by the computer’s CPU.
A program written in an interpreted language is not compiled, it is interpreted.
6
This language delivers better performance.
This languages delivers relatively slower performance.

Example of compiled language – C, C++, C#, CLEO, COBOL, etc.
Example of Interpreted language – JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.
